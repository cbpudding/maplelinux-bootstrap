# FIXME: Setting monolith to true is a workaround since tinyramfs searches for
#        /sbin/kmod, which doesn't work since kmod is installed under /bin.
#        While kmod *should* be moved under /sbin, tinyramfs also shouldn't
#        hard-code paths like that, so we need a way to patch this going
#        forward. Without a proper patch, kernel modules cannot be added to the
#        initramfs, which will cause issues with drivers later on. ~ahill
